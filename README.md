This is Face Recognition project which initiate by jarvis.Let me first introduce with Jarvis

### Jarvis

Jarvis is a Python coding companion. Point it to a python function, and it will execute it. As soon as you change and save your code, Jarvis will detect it, and will rerun the function. If an exception is raised, it will be displayed in the error panel.


Jarvis is just like a google assistant which takes command and open camera to recognise the face.
